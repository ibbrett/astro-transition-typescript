Additions:
- introduced top-level await, allowing the keyword to be used at the top level of modules
- new class elements: public and private instance fields, public and private static fields, private instance methods and accessors, and private static methods and accessors; static blocks inside classes, to perform per-class evaluation initialization; 
- the #x in obj syntax, to test for presence of private fields on objects
- regular expression match indices via the /d flag, which provides start and end indices for matched substrings
- the cause property on Error objects, which can be used to record a causation chain in errors
- the <i>at</i> method for Strings, Arrays, and TypedArrays, which allows relative indexing
- Object.property.hasOwn(), a convenient alternative to Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()
