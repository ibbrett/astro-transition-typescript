Additions:
- Array.prototype.flat, Array.prototype.flatMap
- changes to Array.sort
- Object.fromEntries

```bash>
Array.sort is now guaranteed to be stable, meaning that elements with equal sorting keys will not change relative order before and after the sort operation. Array.prototype.flat(depth=1) flattens an array to a specified depth, meaning that all subarray elements (up to the specified depth) are concatenated recursively.

Another notable change is that so-called catch binding became optional
```
