- Array methods: flat(), flatMap()
- changes to Array.prototype.sort()
- Object.fromEntries()
  - static method transforms a list of key-value pairs into an object
- String methods: trimStart(), trimEnd()
- Optional catch binding
  - allows you to omit the parameter in the catch block, enabling you to catch an exception without explicitly assigning it to a variable
- Symbol.prototype.description
- Function.prototype.toString()
- BigInt
- Promise.allSettled()

```bash
Array.sort is now guaranteed to be stable, meaning that elements with equal sorting keys will not change relative order before and after the sort operation. Array.prototype.flat(depth=1) flattens an array to a specified depth, meaning that all subarray elements (up to the specified depth) are concatenated recursively.

Another notable change is that so-called catch binding became optional
```
